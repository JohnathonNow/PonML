# PonML
A Python to Minilang transpiler

Meant as an April Fools joke, takes Python and turns it into an equivalent [minilang](https://github.com/wrapl/minilang) script.

Early work in progress.

Currently supports:  
- Variables
- For loops
- Many operators
- Functions
- Function calls
- Strings, ints, and floats
- Imports

Planned to support:  
- More operators (booleans, comparisons)
- Lists and maps
- fStrings
- try.. except...
- Conditionals
- While loops

Not currently planned:  
- Classes
- Methods
