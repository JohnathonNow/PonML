# PonML
A Python to Minilang transpiler

Meant as an April Fools joke, takes Python and turns it into an equivalent [minilang](https://github.com/wrapl/minilang) script.

Very early work in progress.

Planned to support:  
- Variables
- Operators
- For loops
- Functions
- Function calls
- Lists and maps
- Strings, ints, and floats
- fStrings
- imports
